# Getting Started with Frontend Career

The purpose of this roadmap is to give you an idea about the frontend development. The road map will guide you if you are confused about what to learn next, rather than encouraging you to pick what is hype and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would be better suited for some cases than the other and remember that hype and trendy do not always mean best suited for the job.
What you will be able to see as a scenario is a text page about the possibilities and assumptions that can be used when learning and mastering the skills of a frontend developer.
At the same time, all this is a small idea and a path towards realization for all of us who always try to do our best in order to become better and more successful in overcoming obstacles and solving daily problems.
