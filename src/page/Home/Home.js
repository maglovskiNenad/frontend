          The purpose of this roadmap is to give you an idea about the frontend
          development. The road map will guide you if you are confused about
          what to learn next, rather than encouraging you to pick what is hype
          and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would
          be better suited for some cases than the other and remember that hype
          and trendy do not always mean best suited for the job.

          What you will be able to see as a scenario is a text page about the
          possibilities and assumptions that can be used when learning and
          mastering the skills of a frontend developer. At the same time, all
          this is a small idea and a path towards realization for all of us who
          always try to do our best in order to become better and more
          successful in overcoming obstacles and solving daily problems. The
          following information that you can find here is of a text type, you
          could say a mini library of information that can be used for your
          project as well.

          Of course, this site is not a site that will explain to you how to
          solve some of the problems you have encountered on your way to a
          front-end development career, but it is certainly a small treasure of
          valuable information that you can certainly remind yourself of how
          some of the elements in the world of programming should you use.
