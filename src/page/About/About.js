        How to explain this part. I have always said "nothing interesting on
        this page", just some complaints and motivational texts. And how does
        this differ from others who have already made something similar to this.
        To be honest, there is no difference, everything was created with a
        slightly beginner's idea, a great desire and motivation to learn and
        create.
      </p>
      <p className="home-text">
        As a beginner in the world of programming, everyone tries to motivate
        you and tell you how good you are at it, and that main sentence that
        closes the whole circle "Look at him, he succeeded, so you will too" and
        with some of those motivational verses, we decided to create a small
        library that will enable us to write some kind of path that we have
        traveled and learned a little bit.
      </p>
      <p className="home-text">
        Of course, there are always those mistakes that will hold us back and
        tell us, don't do it this way. I can't say that we had a lot of ideas
        and a lot of creativity for all of this, but still the idea itself was
        to make something happen and thus really start it all.In the best hope
        that you will like all this as much as possible and that you will pass
        on any criticism to us. Our plan in the future is for this to become
        just a better project that at some point will certainly make some sense
        both for us and for all those who will browse and look for what would
        make it easier for them to create new paths and problems in the world of
        programming.
